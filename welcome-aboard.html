                Hello, and welcome aboard plambo.world! My name is Austin Plambeck. I’m a 24-year-old writer, web developer, and environmentalist from southern California.
                <br><br>
                I began my coding journey in early 2021. After a few attempts at learning some old programming languages — C & C++ — I moved on to HTML and CSS, which I liked much better and I’m now proficient in them (shoutout to Codecademy). This fall I started on JavaScript, and I’m hoping to implement some of what I’ve been learning to this website and other projects soon enough.
                <br><br>
                As for  writing — I’m currently in the late stages of revising a novel I had previously shelved last year, and I’m happy to say I’ll be self-publishing it later this winter! I came up with the idea for this story in January of 2018, which, for lack of a better phrase, feels like a lifetime ago. Back then, it was just a vague concept — two opposite planets whose peoples represent good and evil collide and go to war. And over the years it developed into something much more than that, I think. It became more of a self-indulgent endeavor. In the beginning, I was writing a story I thought the world would want to read, and over time I wrote the exact story <span>I</span> would want to read. It has everything I personally love — complex characters, contrasting worlds, heroes with darkness, sad villains who are essentially death gods on a journey toward life, romantic drama, defying prophecies, a big-ass final battle, redemption and atonement, and an overarching theme of hope and goodness in all things. So, if any of that sounds entertaining to you, make sure to read my book. :)
                <br><br>
                In addition, I’ll be posting short stories on here — I have no idea when, to be honest. But they’ll be on here eventually. I have about eight solid story ideas, a few of which have detailed outlines, and all with an overarching dark-fairytale-vibe-thing going on in them. So, sometime in 2022, I’ll compile those into a little short story book to be self-published. In the meantime, I might post some of my old short stories on here — though they’re two years old and not really my best work.
                <br><br>
                I’m also in the very, <span>very</span> early stages of designing a text-only, choice-based game. This will be one of my bigger projects and it’ll require a lot of programming knowledge that I don’t have yet — so stay tuned for this archetypal, mythic journey heavily inspired by <span>The Green Knight (2021)</span> and the philosophies of Joseph Campbell.
                <br><br>
                A few years back, I earned my B.S. in Environmental Science & Resource Management from the University of Washington. Though my career path has strayed far from this field, environmental science, ecology, and climate justice are still areas of great interest to me (they’re also terrifyingly relevant to our present moment) — so I’ll be writing short blog posts with the goal of spreading knowledge and raising awareness on these topics.
                <br><br>
                This post has jumped around quite a bit, so if you read to the end — <span>thanks, I love you!</span> I’m excited to finally make this site open to the world and I’m looking forward to a future filled with more coding and more writing and more stories. And I hope you stick around to see it happen.
                <br><br>
                I’ll be making an email list soon, for the few of you who want my random thoughts and words thrown atop your already-overflowing inbox.
                <br><br>
                See you later.
            </p>
