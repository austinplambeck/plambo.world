            <h3>October 29th, 2021</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="contentWritingMobile2">
            <p>
                I think that writing a novel is my biggest accomplishment to date. It took hundreds upon hundreds of hours — 
                planning, outlining, writing, editing, revising, rewriting, and rewriting, and rewriting again. Put simply, 
                it is extremely difficult. You must balance the creativity and freedom of making up ideas and the structural, 
                almost formulaic, design of a story. You must have stakes and conflict and compelling characters who change 
                along the journey. And you must write. Consistently. Over and over again. Until there are hundreds of pages, 
                thousands of words. As my friend Phil would put it: 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://philsnextstop.blog/2021/10/23/work-is-hard-reframe-it-to-make-success-inevitable/">
                    you have to climb the mountain to get this done, and that climb requires discipline</a>.
                <br><br>
                Because of my countless failures and setbacks, I’ve learned many valuable lessons. And I thought I’d write 
                them here in hopes that it will help someone. This will be Part 1 of 2, with this part covering writing a 
                first draft, and the next part covering editing and revising it.
            </p>
            <h4 id="novelArticle1List">Lesson 1: Discover your story your own way</h4>
            <p id="novelArticle1Paragraph">
                I had a very strong idea for my story — an overall concept for a plot, which I thought would be interesting and 
                fun to explore. And I decided to commit to it and build it, with the thought that I’d eventually write it. I was 
                heavily inspired by two particular stories — <span>Avatar: The Last Airbender</span> and <span>Star Wars</span> — 
                and used them as influences for my themes and certain aspects of the world.
                <br><br>
                At first, I didn’t do much research on how to write a novel. I just started writing notes to build the world 
                and the characters — to flesh out my ideas and make up new ones. I took it very slowly, as I knew I wasn’t ready 
                to jump into writing a novel when I’d never written anything to that capacity before. So I was consistent with it, 
                writing notes on my story about four times per week, for five months straight.
                <br><br>
                Nowadays when I'm plotting a new novel, I first take a wider, more broad view of the whole story and outline the 
                key points. From there, I'll get closer and start filling in more details, separating these main story beats into 
                different acts. In addition, I always focus on finding a midpoint where the story changes directions drastically. 
                Either the protagonist makes a new, harrowing discovery, they hit a low point, or their goal seems as unattainable 
                as ever.
                <br><br>
                If you want to learn more about midpoints for yourself, go to one of your favorite movies and fast forward to the 
                halfway mark. It's very likely it'll be a major turning point or a new discovery will be made. (I just looked at 
                <span>Spider-Man 2</span> (2004) and Peter gave up being Spider-Man at the halfway point — which is also the 
                halfway point in his trilogy.)
                <br><br>
                Anyways. This slow outlining and notetaking path is what seemed most logical to me when I first wrote 
                my novel, but there are people out there who won’t need any detailed outline or fleshed-out notes to start writing. 
                And that absolutely works too. Go about it your own way and take time to figure out what works for <span>you</span>.
            </p>
            <h4 id="novelArticle1List">Lesson 2: Start writing about the strongest image you can see in your mind</h4>
            <p id="novelArticle1Paragraph">
                All stories need a strong opening, and many writers say to start writing at the latest possible point. 
                Start within the action, not before it.
                <br><br>
                I had a vivid image I could see in my mind, that would fit in the beginning. So one day, I wrote about that image and 
                that was the jumping off point for my story. I think once you get the ball rolling, it’s a lot easier to keep it going.
                <br><br>
                Keep in mind that this first scene will change when you go back to revise and rewrite. So there is 
                <span>no pressure</span> writing the opening scene. Yes, try your best. But in no way does this have to be 
                brilliant writing. The perfect opening chapter in a first draft is a complete one.
            </p>
            <h4 id="novelArticle1List">Lesson 3: Consistency is the only option</h4>
            <p id="novelArticle1Paragraph">
                I wrote about five times per week over the span of eight months — and the result was a 135,000-word first draft. 
                It was a complete mess, but it was done, and all of my thoughts were on the page, ready to be cut and mended and redone.
                <br><br>
                I did this during my senior year of college — balancing writing and 18 units per quarter. And believe me, 
                I am <span>NOT</span> the most disciplined person and I wasn’t in a rigid routine writing every day at 6am or 
                something. It was random and sporadic bursts of writing — sometimes after I finished homework at 1am, sometimes 
                while eating lunch between classes, and sometimes during a lecture. The only consistent thing I did was 
                put words on my Google Doc about five times per week. And after eight months — which is a long time — I had a draft done.
            </p>
            <h4 id="novelArticle1List">Lesson 4: Set goals & keep track of your progress</h4>
            <p id="novelArticle1Paragraph">
                One of the things that helped me stay consistent was setting goals for myself. And these goals started <span>small</span>. 
                One goal was to write 40,000 words in 100 days — that’s 400 words per day, just over a page of double-spaced 
                writing. And even if I missed a day of writing, I could make it up the next day by writing a bit more. When I 
                beat that goal, I set it a little higher — 50,000 words in 100 days — and beat that too. This strategy worked very 
                well for me, and it might work for you too.
                <br><br>
                I also made an excel spreadsheet to track all of my progress — I kept the date, the number of words I wrote, 
                and the total word count. This was another motivator for me because the progress becomes visual as your 
                numbers stack up.
            </p>
            <h4 id="novelArticle1List">Lesson 5: One step down</h4>
            <p id="novelArticle1Paragraph">
                Finishing writing a first draft is a huge accomplishment and will probably feel like a big relief — it did for me. 
                But that is just one piece of the puzzle in completing a novel, and the next steps in editing and revising might 
                take even longer than your first draft did.
                <br><br>
                However, if you’ve written a whole first draft, put in that much work, you’re absolutely capable of finishing the job.
            </p>
            <h4 id="novelArticle1List">Some additional tips:</h4>
            <p id="novelArticle1Paragraph2">
                I didn’t cover coming up with a story too much in this post, as I think it’s a very unique endeavor for each 
                individual and it can happen in many ways. But here are some things I’d recommend to help ideas and creativity flow:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consume stories and analyze them</li>
                <li>Re-consume your favorite stories and analyze them further</li>
                <li>Figure out what you love in stories, as writing about what you love is much easier than not</li>
                <li>Become familiar with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_mythology">mythology</a>, 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stenudd.com/myth/freudjung/jung-archetypes.htm">archetypes</a>, 
                    and <a target="_blank" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tropes">tropes</a></li>
                <li>Become familiar with the 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure">three-act structure</a> 
                    (this is the most common, but there are other act structures that work too), 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirty-Six_Dramatic_Situations">the 36 dramatic situations</a>,

            </ul>
            <p id="novelArticle1Paragraph">
                If you know what you love, I think it’s easier to <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/nJPERZDfyWc">remix</a> 
                pieces of your favorite stories, add your own personality to it, and create something completely new.
