                Revisions are scary. You must confront your mistakes, receive daunting feedback, and figure out how to make your work better. It's also a process with no clear finish. You don't just type "The End" like you did while writing your first draft. Finishing this journey will take much, much more than that.
                <br><br>
                We’re back with Part 2 of the many lessons I learned while writing a novel! (If you haven’t already, go read the first post <a target="_blank" href="novel-lessons-I-learned-part1.html">here</a> — it covers writing a first draft.)
            </p>
            <h4 id="novelArticle1List">Lesson 6: Reverse outline your completed first draft</h4>
            <p id="novelArticle1Paragraph">
                If you’re like me, your first draft will be somewhat all over the place. A few unnecessary scenes (and even unnecessary characters). Plot holes you couldn’t see the first go-through. Story beats that need to be expanded upon. Straight-up bad writing, both prose- and story-wise.
                <br><br>
                One of the best lessons I learned is to re-outline, or reverse outline, your draft. In every chapter, you analyze what happens and what that shows about the characters. This is a great way to get a wider perspective of the story, and it ensures that each chapter pushes the plot and characters forward. (Side note: not every chapter needs a major conflict that changes the characters and propels them to the next plot point. Simple scenes are necessary too — like a conversation that adds layers to a character and deepens the reader’s investment in the story. Those small moments can carry a ton of weight.)
                <br><br>
                With reverse outlining, you can spot problems and plot holes and the places where you need just a little something more. It's necessary if you want to make your story better.
            </p>
            <h4 id="novelArticle1List">Lesson 7: Revise, revise, revise...</h4>
            <p id="novelArticle1Paragraph">
                This lesson might seem obvious, but I need to reinforce the necessity of it. Especially because you might spend more time revising than you did writing the first draft.
                <br><br>
                If you recall from <a target="_blank" href="novel-lessons-I-learned-part1.html">Part 1</a>, my first draft of <span>Tomorrow’s Storm</span> was 135,000 words. I spent about four months revising it — with broad, story-level edits (with help from reverse outlining), edits by chapter, and prose/grammar-specific line edits. Taking the story and editing it from those three different angles helped me tremendously, and that might work for you too.
                <br><br>
                I ended up with a 120,000-word second draft that I was satisfied with… until I wasn’t.
                <br><br>
                After receiving feedback from a freelance editor, I realized my novel relied too much on a sequel. It didn’t tell a cohesive story that could stand alone. It didn’t resolve the major conflict, and I knew it wouldn’t give readers a satisfying resolution. It might seem like that would be tough news to bear, but surprisingly, it wasn’t. When you spend months and months looking at something from one perspective, it becomes hard to recognize the faults. I couldn't see where it could be improved. What this freelance editor told me was completely obvious, but I couldn’t see it. I was just grateful to become aware of it. And this leads me to the next lesson.
            </p>
            <h4 id="novelArticle1List">Lesson 8: You can’t do it all by yourself</h4>
            <p id="novelArticle1Paragraph">
                Get feedback from beta-readers, freelance editors, friends, family — anyone willing to read. Other perspectives, especially ones you respect and trust, are key. They will point out things you would've never seen. Their critiques, challenges, and affirmations will make your story <span>better</span> in every way.
            </p>
            <h4 id="novelArticle1List">Lesson 9: Rewriting is always necessary, to varying degrees</h4>
            <p id="novelArticle1Paragraph">
                As it turns out, the first book you write isn’t always brilliant work worthy to be picked up by a Big 5 publishing house. From my experience, the first book you write is a stepping stone on your journey of being a writer. You make a <span>ton</span> of mistakes, you learn from them, and you move on to the next idea. For others, it might be different. But for someone like me, who wrote their first novel with little prior experience writing fiction, it was exactly that.
                <br><br>
                And so, I rewrote my entire book. (And I might fuck around and do it again in the future). I twisted around the plot, cut out some characters, revised arcs, added story beats, and gave it a satisfying resolution. <span>Tomorrow's Storm</span> could finally stand alone as a single novel. I only did this because I loved my idea so much and I was convinced it could be great if I kept chipping away at it. Other writers might want to shelve their story and move on, but I didn’t.
                <br><br>
                My rewrite led to some of my best writing ever. And I grew as a writer in ways I’d never thought possible. I had such a clear vision for the characters and the plot and the messages I was trying to convey. And it turns out when your vision is clear, your work is efficient. This rewrite ended up at a slim 87,000 words — <span>nearly 200 pages shorter</span> than my first draft.
                <br><br>
                Now, you might not end up rewriting your entire novel, but I guarantee you’ll rewrite a chapter — probably many. And your writing will only get better and better.
            </p>
            <h4 id="novelArticle1List">Lesson 10: Write what you love</h4>
            <p id="novelArticle1Paragraph">
                Don’t cater to today’s trends or what you think other readers will want to read. Write exactly what you love. Your passion will be clear; it will shine through the work. If you truly love what you’re writing about, <span>it will</span> be a good story.
                <br><br>
                As I said in my <a href="welcome-aboard.html">first blog post</a>, my novel became very self-indulgent as time passed. My continuous motivation to make <span>Tomorrow's Storm</span> work came from my love for the story.
                <br><br>
                I kept revising until my beginning, middle, and end were strong and flowed well into each other. My revisions finished and added a little bulk to my novel, with 101,000 total words. Still clean and efficient, but with added scenes to strengthen the characters, their arcs, and the worldbuilding.
            </p>
            <h4 id="novelArticle1List">Lesson 11: Finishing a novel and putting it out into the world (or not)</h4>
            <p id="novelArticle1Paragraph">
                At first, I wanted my novel to be traditionally published. I sent query letters (a brief hook/synopsis of your story) to literary agents in hopes of getting signed. But after many rejections, a depression-induced break from writing, and some semi-big realizations, I thought it would be better if I self-published <span>Tomorrow’s Storm</span>.
                <br><br>
                At the time I made that decision, it had felt like I’d been sitting on my novel for far too long. And if I never did anything about it, it would be laying dormant in my hard drive forever. I thought it would be better if I put some work out into the world at some point, and I had a whole novel nearly ready to go. So, fuck it, why not?
                <br><br>
                As I'm writing this, I'm in the middle of doing a final revision before I self-publish. I could keep revising and rewriting forever, but at some point, I need to move on. <span>Tomorrow's Storm</span> will be done when I say it's done. As the artist, you have the final say in when your work is finished. And it might take a lot of time to figure out when that is.
                <br><br>
                When you’ve come to the final steps of revising your novel, after so much time and effort, you’re going to have to make this same decision for yourself. <span id="novelLessons2BoldText">What do you want to do with your completed novel?</span> And like how creating a story is a very personal process, this is as well. Only you know what’s right for you. And if you want to fight to get your book traditionally published, then do it! I plan on doing that with my next novel, no matter how long it takes. If you want to self-publish, then do it! That’s amazing. And if you conclude that you never want your novel to see the light of day, that’s okay too.
            </p>
            <p id="blogPostSpacing">***</p>
            <p>That’s it for the lessons I learned while writing my first novel. If you’ve read both parts, know that I really appreciate it! And hopefully you found these two posts interesting and helpful. See you next time.</p>
